# EmailBulletin
Developed 01/02/2019

This was designed to get around a mail merge issue for one specific recurring task.

- The list of recipients is pulled out of a pay role system in an untidy spreadsheet and needs to be exported on a monthly basis.
- The user needed to send a monthly mail merge with an attachment. 
- The user maintains a list of recipients who do NOT wish to receive the emails and must be removed from the exported list.

This program simply takes the exported email list, the list of emails to be removed, and the path to the attachment, and sends all recipients the required email.
